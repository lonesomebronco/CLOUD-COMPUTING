# CLOUD-COMPUTING PROJECT
# Providing SaaS using Docker Containers over the cloud
We present a Software as a service run using easy to handle and manage docker containers, using SSH which eliminates the need for organizations(consumers) to install and run applications on their computers or in their own data centers instead running and using computation powers of the service provider.
The solution minimizes the overhead needed for the service provider by using Containerization technology equipped with SSH for clients.
Software used for this purpose - Firefox

## What do we need to do to provide firefox as a service?

- **Run a container instance, and make it ready to use for the client by installing the software and the dependencies needed to run it.**
- **Make an image out of the instance and host it.**
- **Now, to provide different instances to different clients, we just need to make different docker instances for the different clients from the above image.**

# CLOUD-COMPUTING PROJECT
# Providing SaaS using Docker Containers over the cloud
We have used Software as a Service (SaaS), a way of
delivering applications over the network — as a service.
Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply
access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex
software and hardware management. The technique uses
containerization using Dockers to provide different instances of
the same Software Application to different customers. It is a
way of encapsulating a Software Application with all of its
related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies
required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across
different computing environments. We provide SAAS using
Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, a software package that enables
secure system administration and file transfers over insecure
networks. The Service Provider might have to provide
Graphical Application and for that, we have used
X11-Forwarding, a mechanism that allows a user to start up
remote applications but forward the application display to
your machine. It is providing one way for an SSH connection to
access graphical applications running on the SSH server.
Finally, we present a Firefox application as a service run using
docker containers, using SSH which eliminates the need for
organizations to install and run applications on their
computers or in their own data centers.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
How SAAS can be provided to the consumers effectively with proper isolation and consistency?

## SOLUTION

We present a solution to provide Software as a service application, using easy to handle and manage docker containers, using SSH which eliminates the need for organizations(consumers) to install and run applications on their computers or in their own data centers instead running and using computation powers of the service provider.</ br>
The solution minimizes the overhead needed for the service provider by using Containerization technology equipped with SSH for clients.</ br>
Software used for this purpose - Firefox


## What do we need to do to provide firefox as a service?

- **Run a container instance, and make it ready to use for the client by installing the software and the dependencies needed to run it.**
- **Make an image out of the instance and host it.**
- **Now, to provide different instances to different clients, we just need to make different docker instances for the different clients from the above image.**
